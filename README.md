# Speedtrack-System
SpeedTrack System is a microcontroller-based project using the 8051 to measure speed. It calculates the time taken by an object to travel between two IR sensors placed at a fixed distance and displays the speed on a 16x2 LCD. It's useful for traffic monitoring and educational purposes.
